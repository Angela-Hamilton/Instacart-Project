# Instacart Project
Data analysis project using data from Instacart Grocery Basket, an online grocery store that operates through an app.

# Objective
Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective of this project is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and suggest strategies to ensure that Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

* departments

# Tools
Python
### Imported Libraries
* Pandas as pd
* Numpy as np
* Os
* Matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* Seaborn as sns

# Skills Demonstrated
* Data Wrangling - change data types of variables into more suitable types and rename columns where needed.
* Data Consistency Checks  - removed duplicates, found and resolved missing values, and addressed mixed-type variables.
* Combining & Exporting Data - merged dataframes and exported the merged data as a pickle file.
* Grouping & Aggregating Data - created flags and placed them in new columns, created summary columns of descriptive statistics using the groupby () function.
* Data Visualizations in Python - created histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots for different variables.

# Presenting Results
Created an Excel Report that explained the answers to questions from the sales/marketing teams and documentation of the different steps conducted for consistency checks, data wrangling, and column derivations.
